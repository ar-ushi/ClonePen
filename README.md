<h3>To Run App</h3>
<ul>
  <li><h3>npm start</h3> Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. </li>
   <li><h3>npm test</h3> Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. </li>
     <li><h3>npm run build</h3> Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. </li>
   <li><h3>npm eject</h3> If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. </li>
  </ul>
